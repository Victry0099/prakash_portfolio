        Welcome to Real News, the ultimate source of news from around the world. Real News is a web application that uses React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create a fast and responsive news website.
    </p>
    <p class="about_para">
        With Real News, you can:
    </p>
    <p class="about_para">
        - Browse the latest headlines from various categories, such as business, entertainment, health, science, sports, and technology. <br>
        - Search for news articles by keywords, sources, or domains. <br>
        - Read the full article on the original website with a single click.  <br>
        - Share your favorite articles with your friends on social media platforms. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="about_para">
        Real News uses the Bing News Search API, a powerful and intelligent service that provides relevant and comprehensive news results. The API uses artificial intelligence to ensure the most accurate and up-to-date news articles.
    </p>
    <p class="about_para">
        Real News is built with React class-based components, which are reusable pieces of code that manage their own state and lifecycle. Class-based components inherit from the React.Component class and have access to its methods and properties. Class-based components also have a render() method, which returns the HTML to be displayed on the web page.
    </p>
    <p class="about_para">
        Real News consists of the following class-based components:
    </p>
    <p class="about_para">
        - App: The main component that renders the entire application and handles the state and logic of the news search and display. <br>
        - Header: The component that renders the header section of the web page, which contains the logo, the navigation menu, and the search bar. <br>
        - NewsList: The component that renders the list of news articles, which are fetched from the API using the query parameters from the state of the App component.<br>
        - NewsItem: The component that renders a single news article, which contains the title, the source, the date, the image, and the link to the original website.<br>
        - Footer: The component that renders the footer section of the web page, which contains the social media icons and the credits.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="about_para">
        Real News is a simple and elegant news website that showcases the power and flexibility of React and the Bing News Search API. You can check out the source code of Real News on [GitHub] <br>
